				Since I was little, I loved watching YouTube videos and the idea
				of bringing joy and laughter to a wider audience. Thus, I began
				my journey in content creation through YouTube videos and Twitch
				streaming. I typically do coworking & study streams to keep
				myself accountable and encourage productivity amongst viewers. I
				also do software and game development streams where I showcase
				my workflow.

					In my Mobile App Development unit in University, I am tasked
					to develop Android apps using Android Studio. The final app
					project I had developed was a LLM-powered quiz app with
					features such as choosing your own topics, viewing your
					question attempt history afterwards, and upgrading your tier
					with Google Pay.
