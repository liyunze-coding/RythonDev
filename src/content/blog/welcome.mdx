## Introduction

This is my first blog post, where I share my plans on what type of blogs are to be shared here. The purpose of the blog is for me to share what I know without having to create a video about it. 

The types of blogs that I will share here will be, but not limited to:

- Tutorials, Tips & Tricks
  - Streaming
  - Web Development
  - Python
- News & Opinions

## Who am I?

Well, if you don't know who I am, you can find out on my website [here](/). But if you want me to put it in short, I would say that I am mainly a:

- Streamer
- Software Developer

## What's special about this blog?

In my experience, when I wanted to look at blogs from medium or article sites, it would either be flooded with ads, get prompted to disable ad blocker, or be completely locked behind a paywall. Although there are ways to bypass those, I find that searching for information has been inconvenient.

Hence, I want my blog to be minimal, without any ads nor paywalls. I believe that information and knowledge should be free, and easy to consume.
